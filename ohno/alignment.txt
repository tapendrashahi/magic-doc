Order of preferable respiratory substrate is: Glucose, fat, protein
Glucose is the first preferred substrate of respiration and when complex carbohydrate and fats are used as respiratory substrate, it is called floating respiration.
When protein is used as the respiratory substrate, it is called protoplasmic respiration.
Depending upon the oxygen required, respiration may be aerobic or anaerobic respiration.

Aerobic respiration has four continuous processes:

Glycolysis in cytosol/cytoplasm (EMP pathway),
Oxidative decarboxylation in outer and Perimitochondrial space,
Kreb cycle in mitochondrial matrix (Tricarboxylic acid cycle or TCA cycle) but in bacteria it occurs in cytosol and
Oxidative phosphorylation in inner membrane of mitochondria (Terminal oxidation, ETS)
1. Glycolysis

Carbohydrate to enter into glycolysis, the glucose and fructose derived from hydrolysis of starch, sucrose or fructans must first be converted to hexose phosphates.
Six carbon compounds - Glucose is broken down into 3-carbon compound pyruvic acid with net release of 2 ATP and

Glycolysis includes 10 enzymatic steps,
Irreversible reactions: conversion of glucose into glucose 6 phosphate, conversion of fructose6 phosphate to fructose 1, 6-diphosphate.
Primary Rate determining enzymes: phosphofructokinase.
Reaction that does not require enzyme is conversion of 1,3 biphosphoglyceraldehyde into 1, 3 diphosphoglycerate.
Total production of 4 ATP in glycolysis, 2 ATP while converting 1,3 diphosphoglycerate to 3 phosphoglycerate and 2 ATP while converting 3 phosphoenol pyruvate to pyruvate.

(1935,1945) and Johnson (1937) .

(−COOH) , hence called TCA or tricarboxylic acid cycle.
The reactions of TCA cycle starts by condensation of acetyl - CoA with oxaloacetic acid (OAA) catalyzed by the citrate synthetase producing citric acid.
All the reaction takes place in mitochondrial matrix except reduction of FAD which occurs in inner membrane of mitochondria because succinate dehydrogenase present only in inner membrane.
It produces intermediate metabolites (both anabolic and catabolic) so called amphibolic or Anapleurotic pathway.
Only one 5 carbon compound is formed during Kreb's cycle i.e

In the oxidation reaction step, the hydrogen acceptor is NAD but in case of oxidation of succinic acid, the hydrogen acceptor is FAD.
4. Oxidative phosphorylation or ETS or Terminal oxidation

It is the last step of aerobic respiration, the reduced coenzymes produced during glycolysis and Krebs cycle get oxidized by molecular oxygen.
Synthesis of ATP by oxidation and reduction of cytochrome cofactors and coenzymes (NADH + and FADH + in presence of ATP synthetase present in oxysome (elementary particles or Fo and F1 particles) of inner membrane of mitochondria and called as oxidative phosphorylation.
All the enzymes required for ETS are found in the F1 particles of mitochondria.
In the ETS, electrons flow from more electronegative carrier to more electropositive carrier
Oxidation and reduction process occurs in FAD, UQ, Cyt. complexes.
The electron transport chain in mitochondria consists of 4 multiprotein electron transport complexes:
Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase)
Complex II (Succinate dehydrogenase)

Factor Responsible for Respiration

Light: It has no direct role in respiration. However, stomata open in presence of light which indirectly helps in exchange of respiratory gases. Respiratory rates in leaves adapted to full sun (sun leaves) are generally higher than those of leaves of the same species adapted to shade.
Oxygen: Oxygen is essential for aerobic respiration but higher concentration oxygen inhibits the respiration which is known as Pasteur's effect.
Temperature: The optimum temperature for respiration is

If the plant transferred from water to salt solution, the rate of respiration increases called salt respiration. It is due to absorption of ions require metabolic energy.
Any injury, wounds and infections increase the rate of respiration for healing meristematic activities are required.
Rate of respiration decreases with increase in age.
Chemicals like, cyanides, azides, rotenone, antimycin, amytal, DNP etc inhibit the respiration.
Increasing the concentration of carbondioxide decreases the rate of respiration. During respiration approximately 113 Kcal energy release per molecule of oxygen absorbed.
Hormones like auxin, gibberellins, cytokinin increase the rate of respiration, specially ethylene is climacteric hormone that accelerates the rate of respiration.
