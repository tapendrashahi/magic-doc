<p>In mathematics, a matrix is a rectangular array or table of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns, which is used to represent a mathematical object or a property of such an object. The horizontal lines are called rows and the vertical lines are called columns.</p>

<p><strong>A =</strong>  [ a₁₁  a₁₂  ···  a₁ₙ <br>
&nbsp; a₂₁  a₂₂  ···  a₂ₙ <br>
&nbsp; ⋮ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ⋱ &nbsp;&nbsp; ⋮ <br>
&nbsp; aₘ₁  aₘ₂  ···  aₘₙ ]</p>

<p>The matrix A is also represented as A = (aᵢⱼ) where i represents the row and j represents the column.</p>

<p><strong>Some special types of matrices and terms related to matrices</strong></p>

<p><strong>Square matrix :</strong> A matrix is called square matrix if there are same number of rows as the number of columns.</p>

<p><strong>Diagonal Matrix:</strong> In a square matrix of size n × n, the terms aᵢᵢ, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n are called diagonal terms. The matrix whose all non-diagonal elements are zero is called a diagonal matrix.</p>

<p><strong>Triangular Matrix :</strong> A matrix whose all elements below or above the diagonal elements are all zero is called a triangular matrix. If the elements are zero below, the then triangle is called upper triangular matrix and if the elements above are zero, the matrix is called lower triangular matrix.</p>

<p><strong>Identity Matrix:</strong> A diagonal matrix with all diagonal elements having value 1 is called identity matrix. Examples,</p>

<p>I₂ =  [ 1  0 <br>
&nbsp; 0  1 ]</p>

<p>I₃ =  [ 1  0  0 <br>
&nbsp; 0  1  0 <br>
&nbsp; 0  0  1 ]</p>

<p>I₄ =  [ 1  0  0  0 <br>
&nbsp; 0  1  0  0 <br>
&nbsp; 0  0  1  0 <br>
&nbsp; 0  0  0  1 ]</p>

<p>I₅ =  [ 1  0  0  0  0 <br>
&nbsp; 0  1  0  0  0 <br>
&nbsp; 0  0  1  0  0 <br>
&nbsp; 0  0  0  1  0 <br>
&nbsp; 0  0  0  0  1 ]</p>
