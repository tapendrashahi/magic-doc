\section*{Blood clotting mechanism by platelet}
1. First stage (Primary haemostasis): A weak platelet plug is formed by:
a. Vasoconstriction or constriction of the blood vessels
b. Platelet adhesion or attachment to the damaged subendothelial part
c. Platelet activation [Change in shape (smooth discs to multipseudopodial plugs) \& cytoplasmic granule by thrombin]
d. Platelet aggregation by the help of fibrinogen
2. Second stage (Secondary haemostasis): Finally, with the help of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, the clotting factors work to stabilise the weak platelet plug by:
a. Activation of clotting factors
b. Modification of prothrombin to thrombin due to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$
c. Modification of fibrinogen to fibrin due to activated thrombin

\section*{Structure of a typical Neuron: Consists of 2 parts (Cell body \& Processes)}

\section*{A. Cell Body or Cyton or Centron or Perikaryon, or Soma}
- Rounded, polygonal, spindle-shaped, flask-shaped, or pyramid-shaped
- Surrounded by a plasma membrane
- Neuroplasm: Cytoplasm of neuron
- Contents of neuroplasm: Nissl granules, Neurofibrils, Golgi apparatus, Ribosome, Endoplasmic reticulum, and others.
- Nissl bodies or Nissl granules, or Nissl substances, or tigroid substances: Discovered by Franz Nissl, a German neuropathologist
- Discrete granular structures (Dark material) in the cytoplasm of somata \& dendrites
- Contain rough endoplasmic reticulum with ribosomes \& mRNA
- Take part in protein synthesis
- A spherical nucleus with a large nucleolus
- Function of cell body: Regulate the functional activities of the cell
B. Processes: 2 branching processes (Axon \& Dendrite)
i. Axon: A long branch arising from axon hillock
- Output of neuron
- Covered by endoneurium
- Axoplasm (Cytoplasm of neuron) surrounded by axolemma
- Branched axon terminal (Terminal bouton or Synapic bouton or Small swelling, or Endfeet)
- Boutons contain neurotransmitter-containing vesicles
ii. Dendrite (Greek: Tree): 1 or many shorter branched processes; Input of neuron; Provided with numerous spines to generate a greater surface area for the neuron to the synapse; Serves to collect messages to the cell body
- Nissl bodies or Nissl granules, or Nissl substances, or tigroid substances: Discovered by Franz Nissl, a German neuropathologist
✓ Discrete granular structures (Dark material) in the cytoplasm of somata and dendrites
✓ Contain rough endoplasmic reticulum with ribosomes and mRNA
✓ Take part in protein synthesis in the neuronal cytoplasm
- Types of connection
✓ Axodendritic: Between axon that synapses on dendrite
✓ Dendrodendritic: Between dendrite that synapses on other dendrites
✓ Axosomatic: Between an axon that synapses on a nerve cell body
✓ Axoaxonic: Between an axon that synapses on another axon
- Immature neurons, or neural stem cells \& neural progenitor cells, can divide.
- Immature neurons or neural stem cells, or neural progenitor cells → Neurons/ Glial cells
- Mature neurons do not undergo division
- Causes of lack of neuronal division
i. Lack of centrosomes (No spindle fibre formation)
ii. Focus on neuronal function rather than division
iii. Potentiality of damage in established connections with other neurons after division
iv. Presence of inhibitory molecules (Nogo proteins)
v. Limited support from oligodendrocytes
vi. Lack of neurolemma/neurilemma \& Schwann cells in CNS
vii. Scar tissue formation by astrocytes following CNS injury, leading to blockage of regrowth and enhancing inhibitory molecules
- Regeneration of neuron in PNS: Possible to a certain limit
✓ Due to Schwann cells and connective tissues around nerve fibres
✓ Not always perfect
✓ Rate of regeneration: $1-5 \mathrm{~mm}$ per day
- $\mathbf{1 ~ m m}$ per day $=$ Small neuron
- $\mathbf{5 ~ m m}$ per day $=$ Large neuron
✓ More successful than regeneration in CNS
✓ Depends on Schwann cell
✓ CNS with limited capacity for regeneration
- Due to inhibitory environment by oligodendrocytes
- Lack of supportive cellular mechanisms
- Rateof CNS regeneration (Spontaneous Axonal Sprouting Rate) $=0.1-<1 \mathrm{~mm}$ per month
- Rate of PNS regeneration (Spontaneous Axonal Sprouting Rate) $=1 \mathrm{~mm}$ per month
- Exceptional cases of neuronal division
✓ Neurons of hippocampus and olfactory bulb undergo neurogenesis (Generation of new neurons)
✓ Hippocampus and olfactory bulb consists of stem cells that can differentiate into new neurons

i. The diameter of the fibre
✓ Large fibres = High surface area = Rapid conduction
ii. Presence or absence of myelin
✓ Myelin speeds signal conduction. For example, the speed of impulse is about $0.5-2.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$ in $2-4 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ unmyelinated fibres compared to $3-15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$ in myelinated fibres of the same size.
✓ In large myelinated fibres (up to $20 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter), the speed is as fast as $120 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$.
- Significance of slow unmyelinated fibre
✓ During secreting stomach acid or dilating the pupil
- Significance of fast myelinated fibre
