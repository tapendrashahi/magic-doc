## 🎯 The Core Problem (Now Solved)

### What You Discovered
Your LMS has **3 editor views**:
- Normal text editor (no math support)
- Equation block editor (tedious)
- **HTML/KaTeX code view** ⭐ (has KaTeX already!)

### What Was Wrong
Previous attempts:
1. **Plain HTML approach** - Removed equations, lost math
2. **Full document approach** - Added unnecessary HTML structure

### What's Now Clear
Your LMS **already renders KaTeX HTML** - you just need to provide the right format!

## 💡 Key Insight (The Breakthrough)

**Your LMS Already Has KaTeX!**

The reason previous approaches failed:
- ❌ Tried to remove LaTeX (lost math)
- ❌ Tried to add full document structure (broke LMS layout)

The correct approach:
- ✅ Extract equations from Mathpix format
- ✅ Render them with KaTeX (get HTML)
- ✅ Wrap with LMS-specific attributes
- ✅ Return just the fragment (LMS provides the wrapper)

**That's it!** Your LMS was waiting for you to provide this format.

---

## 🎓 What You Now Understand

- ✅ **Why** your previous approaches didn't work
- ✅ **What** your LMS actually needs
- ✅ **How** to convert Mathpix LaTeX to the right format
- ✅ **Where** to make changes in your code
- ✅ **When** to use subprocess vs. inline code
- ✅ **How to test** if your implementation is correct
