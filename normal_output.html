<h2>Tissues</h2>
<div>- The word tissue is derived from texere (Latin: &#x27;weave&#x27;)
✓ Meaning of texere: Cells that form tissues are woven together.
- Tissue: A group or layer of specialised cells with a similar structure and perform a specific function.
✓ A level of organisation in multicellular organism
✓ An assembly of similar cells and their extracellular matrix from same embryonic origin
✓ An aggregate of cells usually of a particular kind together with their intercellular substance that form one of the structural materials of life
- Tissue shows an inflammatory reaction to an infection or injury.
- Present in the multicellular animals from the Phylum Coelenterata to Phylum Chordata [No true tissues are present in Phylum Porifera although cells are present and they are cellular-grade]
- Groups of tissues: Produce organs
- Groups of organs: Produce systems
- Groups of the systems: Produce a single body</div>
<h2>History of Tissues/Histology</h2>
<div>- Marcello Malpighi (1628-1694): Founder/Pioneer of Microscopical Anatomy, Founder of Histology; Father of Histology; Father of Physiology and Embryology
- Malpighi: First observation of capillaries in animals and discovered the link between arteries and veins
- Marie Francois Xavier Bichat (1771-1802): Father of Modern Histology
- Bichat: Coined the term &#x27;Tissue&#x27; in 1801
- Bichat&#x27;s Contribution: Identified 21 different types of tissues based on their physical \&amp; functional features without help of microscopes
- &#x27;Histology&#x27; coined by: Dr. Karl Mayer (1819)
- Book of Mayer: On histology and a new division of the tissues of the human body</div>
<h2>Types of Tissues</h2>
<div>- Epithelial tissue or Epithelium or Integumentary, or Protective, or Covering epithelium
- Connective tissue or Tissue of internal environment or Supporting, or Sustentative epithelium
- Muscular tissue or Contractile Tissue
- Nervous tissue or Irritable or Conductive Tissue</div>
<h2>Epithelial Tissues</h2>
<div>Epithelial tissues: Group of cells that form limiting and lining membranes and cover the free surface of an organ, body surface, cavities, \&amp; form glands
- Contain two distinct surfaces (Apical or Free surface \&amp; Basal or Fixed surface)
✓ Apical surface: Exposed to the body cavity
✓ Basal surface: Near the underlying tissue
✓ Tight junctions: Area between apical \&amp; basal surfaces
- Epithelial surface supported on the basal surface by a basement membrane (basal lamina)
✓ Basement membrane: Thin layer of a specialised exracellular matrix
✓ Molecular composition of basement membrane: Collagen IV + Proteoglycans + Nodegen complex
- Derived from all 3 germinal layers (Ectoderm + Mesoderm + Endoderm)
✓ Ectoderm: Skin; Endoderm: Linings of respiratory \&amp; gastrointestinal tract; Mesoderm: Renal epithelium
- Avascular or non-vascular due to lack of blood vessels
- Depend on underlying connective tissues with capillary beds for nutrition \&amp; removal of waste products
- Easily regenerate, i.e., sunburn and skinned knee regeneration.
- Divide throughout their life
- Provided with microvilli (Brushbordered), Stercocilia, Kinocilia, or Flagella
- Bound together in sheets of tissues via forces of interactions:
i. Tight junctions: Form a watertight seal between cells
✓ Tight seal is formed by transmembrane proteins (Claudins + Occludins)
✓ Prevents leakage of molecules between cells (Seal-Forming Junctions)
ii. Gap Junctions (Communication Junctions): Channels for direct communication \&amp; transport of small molecules between cells iii. Adherens Junction: Link the cell membrane \&amp; cytoskeletal elements (Actin) within the cells
✓ Contains a cadherin-catenin complex
iv. Desmosomes: Act like &#x27;Spot Welds&#x27; or &#x27;Rivets&#x27;[Provide strong adhesion between cells]
✓ Use membrane protein (Cadherins) and Intermediate filaments to join cells
- Examples: Hard and horny chitin of insects, scales of fish, horny plates and scales of reptiles, feathers of birds, and hair and nails of mammals Location: Capillary bed; Female reproductive organs; Kidney; Major cavities of the body; Skin; Bile duct and salivary glands; The lining of alveoli or air sacs; Lining of the nose, ear, and eye; Oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, and pancreas</div>

- Smooth muscle layer (Thin layer)
- Endothelium (Simple squamous epithelium)
✓ Afferent lymph vessels: Larger diameter [Transport lymph to a lymph node]
✓ Efferent lymph vessels: Smaller diameter [Transport lymph from one lymph node to another lymph node, or to a larger lymph duct or to the vein]
b. Lymphoid tissue: Development of lymphocytes occurs [2 types: Primary \&amp; Secondary]
- Primary lymphoid tissues: Thymus, embryonic liver, \&amp; adult bone marrow
✓ Produce lymphocytes
- Secondary lymphoid tissues: Spleen \&amp; lymph nodes
✓ Induce maturation of the T lymphocytes
✓ Lymph node: Oval- or kidney-shaped
- Surrounded by a fibrous capsule
- Has outer cortex \&amp; Inner medulla
- Presence of T cell area and B cell follicle
- Both afferent \&amp; efferent lymphatics
- Takes part in
i. filtration of immune cells, antigens, foreign particles;

Main Features of Hodgkin Lymphomas: Giant cells called ReedSternberg cells derived from B lymphocytes detected in lymph nodes
Pancytopenia: Low production of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets Thrombocythemia (Essential Thrombocythemia) (ET): Overproduction of platelets (thrombocytes) in the bone marrow
✓ Chronic myeloproliferative disorder of bonemarrow Illness of polycythemia: Heart failure and low oxygen level
Leukaemia: Cancers of WBCs, which begin in the bone marrow
✓ Uncontrolled production of abnormal white blood cells affecting blood and bone marrow Types of Leukaemia: Acute \&amp; Chronic lymphoblastic
✓ Acute \&amp; Chronic myeloid Myeloid Leukaemia: Excessive production of immature leucocytes [Neutrophils, Basophils, Eosinophils, \&amp; Monocytes] and may involve RBCs \&amp; Platelets from myeloid stem cells
✓ Acute Myeloid Leukaemia: Cancer progresses rapidly
- Occur at any age but more common in adults
✓ Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia: Cancer progresses slowly
- Occur more common in adults Lymphoblastic Leukaemia: Excessive production of immature lymphocytes [B cells, T cells, \&amp; natural killer (NK) cells]
✓ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia: Cancer progresses rapidly
- Occur at any ages but more common in children
✓ Chronic Lymphoblastic Leukaemia: Cancer progresses slowly
- More common in old adults Erythropoiesis: Formation and development of erythrocytes from stem cells called erythrocytoblasts
✓ Erythropoietin Hormone: Released by kidneys during decreased level of oxygen
✓ Haematopoietic stem cells → Erythropoietin hormone by kidney → Proliferation \&amp; Differentiation → Erythrocytes
- First Erythropoiesis Occurring Organs: Mesodermal cells of the yolk in the foetus
- Later Erthropoiesis Occurring Organs: Liver, bone marrow, \&amp; spleen
- Erythropoiesis Occurring Organs in Adults: Red bone marrow of the pelvis, Cranial bones, Tibia, Femur, Sternum, Ribs, \&amp; Vertebrae
- Why RBCs need to remove all cellular structures?: To accommodate more haemoglobin \&amp; oxygen efficiently
- Lack of Nucleus and Mitochondria in RBC: Adaptation to highsugar and high-haem conditions by limiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation
- Sources of energy/ATP for RBC: Anaerobic glycolysis of glucose
- RBC Mode of Respiration: Only anaerobic respiration
- Oxygen-transporting but not using blood cell: RBC
- Why glucose uptake by RBCs is not regulated by insulin?: Due to lack of an insulin receptor on RBCs

<div>- Fasciculi: The parallel bundles of nerve fibres covered by perineurium
- First origin of nervous tissue: In coelenterates
- Coelenterate nervous tissue: Non-polar, impulses move in any direction
- Nerve cord in invertebrates: Solid, double, ventral
- Nerve cord in vertebrates: Hollow, tubular, dorsal
- Nerve: Group of axon
- Ganglion: Group of cytons
- Myelin sheath: Formed by i. Oligodendrocytes [CNS] \&amp; ii. Schwann cells in [PNS]
- Myelin sheath composition: Protein (Myelin basic protein) (20\%)+ Lipid (Phospholipid+Glycolipids+Cholesterol) (80\%)
- Myelin sheath insulating property: Due to Phospholipid + Glycolipids + Cholesterol
- Myelin production \&amp; Maintenance: By Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)
- Myelin sheath colour: A glistening white in colour (Similar to white matter of the brain and spinal cord)
- Myelination: Production of the myelin sheath
- Demyelination: Nerve damage \&amp; consequently neuropathies
- Neurilemma: A thick outermost coil
- Factors affecting the signal speed along with a nerve fibre
i. The diameter of the fibre
✓ Large fibres = High surface area = Rapid conduction
ii. Presence or absence of myelin
✓ Myelin speeds signal conduction. For example, the speed of impulse is about</div>
